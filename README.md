# Usefulness-of-CDC-data-for-disease-risk-prediction
More than 140,000 deaths are attributed to excessive alcohol consumption in the US every year. The main aim of this project was to determine the possibility of mining healthcare and questionnaire data from CDC to generate risk scores for AUD through collection, pre-processing and analysis of survey data through ML models, and then generate a risk score predictor (RSP). The resultant dataset generated was based on survey Data taken from  9254 participants, 85 questions and focused on alcohol, lifestyle and diet and overall health. 

This repository also contains a key results file (named Key_Resuts) and a more detailed report (named FINAL_REPORT_ACM) written in ACM format.
